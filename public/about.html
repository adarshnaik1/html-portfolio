  Hey there! I'm an 18-year-old student currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at Goa College of Engineering. With a passion for all things tech, I've dived into the world of programming and already have a solid grasp of intermediate C and C++. I'm also familiar with the foundations of web development, having dabbled in HTML and CSS. My journey into the realm of technology started early, and I'm thrilled to be on this learning adventure. Whether it's crafting lines of code or designing web layouts, I find joy in every challenge. Join me as I share my experiences, insights, and growth in the dynamic field of computer science and programming. Let's explore the digital landscape together</p>
